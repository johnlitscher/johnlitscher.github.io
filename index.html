	<h4>About me</h4>

	<p>I am currently a junior at Skidmore College. I am a Computer Science major 	and a Math minor and a Statistics minor. My interests include Software 			Development and Machine Learning/Data Science. One area Iâ€™m passionate 	about 	is baseball statistics. One of my current projects web scrap mlb.com 	to get 		statistics from players and performs projections for players (this is 		included on my github).
	</p>

	<p>I am actively involved in a research group at Skdimore College. The research includes a Computer Science professor and 3 other undergraduate students. The topic of our research is Distributed Storage Systems. This project explores how online social network data can be stored and queried using a variety of storage systems. Currently, there is a lack of public knowledge about how to store this type of data. The online social networks that we use rely on the proprietary systems that were developed by the corporations who operate the social network platforms. There are many open questions about the impact of online social networks on society, but it is difficult to study these questions or to develop solutions when the storage systems are proprietary information. Through this project, we will explore methods for using existing distributed storage systems to store and query social network data. This project will create knowledge that can be utilized by researchers who study social networks and by organizations who are developing new social network platforms.
